    <h2>A little bit about myself!</h2>
    <p>Hi there, thanks for stopping by! You may know my grandma Joan from the previous Animal Crossing games but now that she's getting older, it's my turn!</p>
    
    <h2>What do I do exactly?</h2>
    <p>Well, I'm glad you asked, I sell turnips on the Sow Joans market! Every Sunday come see me to buy turnips at whatever price in bells they're listed that day and throughout the week you can check with Tom Nook to see how the market is doing. Buy low and sell high!</p>

    <h2>Any Tips or tricks for me?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Patience, one week the market is prospering, sometimes it just isn't. </li>
        <li>Remember to never time travel in your game because that will cause your turnips to spoil!</li>
        <li>Ask your friends on their islands what the going price of turnips is, it may be higher than your islands!</li>
    </ol>
